1) Globals
  * Attempt to not use globals at all in our code, unless it is properly confined within a black box module
  * if a global is used, include a note in the PR
  
2) Variable naming convention
  * Local variables should have lower starting camel case (varForUse)
  * Global variables should be lower starting camel (varForUse)
  * Constants should be all caps (CONSTANTVAR)
  * Classes should be upper starting camel (VarForUse)
  * Methods should be lower starting camel
  * Avoid numbers and underscores
  * Always be descriptive
  * Avoid 20+ character names
  
3) Indentation
  * 2 space tabs
  * Space after any comma
  * At least one newline between each method/class
  * brackets should start on the same line as if/while/else:
      while(true) {
      ...
      }
  * if else chains should start on the new line, not right after previous bracket
      if(true){
      ...
      }
      else{
      ...
      }
  * Avoid inline blocks wherever possible
  
4) Error returns/handling
  * 0 will be success, anything else will be an error/error code
  * The higher the error no. the more important it is
  * Enum for errors
  * Negative values for blocking/crashing errors, positive for catchable
  
5) Documentation
  * Briefly explain purpose/use case of any classes or important methods
