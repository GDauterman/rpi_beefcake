# BeefCake

**Description**: We are a fitness/wellness app used to track your workouts, sleep, hydration, meals, and more.
Not only do we give you a place to go back and see how you have been doing overtime, but also how your metrics correlate to one another.
  - No longer will you need seperate apps for your workouts and calorie counting.
  - No longer will you struggle to recognize if you hit your daily goals or not.
  - No longer will you be kept in the dark about how your day to day life effects your gains.

 Thanks to BeefCake, getting beefy will be easy as cake


  - **Technology stack**: We utilized flutter, google cloud, and firebase as our technology stack. We refer to this as the google baby for its ease of implementation
